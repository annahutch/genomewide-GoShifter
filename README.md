# genomewide-GoShifter
Code to implement an extension of the GoShifter methodology so that it can be performed on all SNPs genome-wide (rather than index SNPs + LD friends as in the original method).

Note: This is an extension of the GoShifter method originally developed by Trynka et al. (2017) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.05.016)
